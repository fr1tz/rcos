# RC/OS

Note: RC/OS is still in early development, so take the description
      below with a grain of salt.

RC/OS is a free and open-source remote control / data routing application
capable of running on top of Android, iOS, Linux, MS Windows & MacOS X.

It uses a kitchen-sink approach and aims to be able to communicate with
as many existing devices/services as possible.

In addition of being useful as a universal remote control, RC/OS can also route
data between the devices/services its connected to on a fine-grained basis.
For example: The left analog stick on a gamepad connected to PC #1 could be
set-up to control the mouse pointer on PC #2 while the right analog stick on
the same gamepad could be set-up to control a software synthesizer running
on PC #3.
